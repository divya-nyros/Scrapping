== Welcome to scrapping

Scrapping is a technique where we can grab data like images, content, urls etc.

Here is a sample example where we can scrap the data and save it to our local database.

To run this example we need to have all the required ruby gems and also need to install  "mechanize" and  "hpricot" gems which are useful to scrap the content.

In the above "scrapping_file.rb"  we can see authorization. To scrap the data from "http://www.something.com/" we need to login to the site with some credentials.

So i have provided some credentials as

auth = {'email' => 'something@yahoo.com', 'password' => 'password'}

Example 

  @auth = auth
  @agent = Mechanize.new
  @agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac FireFox'
  #~ @keep_alive_time  = 300
  @page = @agent.get('http://www.something.com')
  login_form = @page.forms.first
  login_form.email= @auth['email']
  login_form.password = @auth['password']
  @page = @agent.submit(login_form)
   user=Mysql.new('localhost','root','root','something_development')
   
   
Here in the above  we are creating a new object  "@agent ". It will acts as an agent to grab the data from the "http://www.something.com".

After grabing i am crating a new user and saving the grabed data in to my local database. So that i can use the grabed data to my current application.

100.times do |i|
   i =1+ i
  puts i
  begin
  @page = @agent.get("http://www.something.com/te2/idteacher=676338&idresume=#{i}&idemployer=7214&idjob=180657")
  result_name = (@page/"table[1]/tr[2]/td").inner_text
  
  Here in the below we are grabing the employe name from the "http://www.something.com " with the employer id and the job id.
  And saving that name to our local system.
  
 As well as for the clicking the urls we need to use in the above format.
 
 if @page.link_with(:text => /Personal CV/)
       begin
            result_cv_val= @agent.click(@page.link_with(:text => /Personal CV/))           
              FileUtils.mkdir_p "resume/#{@row}"
              doc = (result_cv_val/"div/iframe").attribute("src").value
              cv_url = doc
              if doc.include? ".DOC"
                 @agent.get(doc).save("resume/#{@row}/#{@row}.DOC")
                 mycv = "#{@row}.DOC"
              elsif doc.include? ".PDF"
                  @agent.get(doc).save("resume/#{@row}/#{@row}.PDF")
                   mycv = "#{@row}.PDF"
              else            
                  mycv = " "  
                  cv_url = " "              
                end
           rescue 
                 mycv = " "  
                cv_url = " " 
             end
      end
	  
To scrap the images or the pdf file we need to use as the below format as creating the folder and saving as doc or the pdf.
in the abobe way we can scrap the related content we want and can save to our database.
 
We need to just run the .rb file by running the f5 in your keybord.
